# Minimalist Qtile Dotfiles

This repository contains minimal dotfiles for Qtile, avoiding the use of login managers and lock managers. The setup relies on X11 for login from the TTY and utilizes X11 xautolock for locking. 

> just read, and ignore

On autolock use system suspension like this:
- systemd users can use `systemctl suspend`
- runit users can use `loginctl suspend`

### Components
- **Qtile Panel Bar**: Customized panel for a clean and sleek look.
- **Dmenu Modified**: Tweaked Dmenu for an enhanced user experience.
- **Wallpaper**: Personally crafted wallpaper to complement the setup.
- **Startx .xinirc**: No login manager used, keeping it simple with startx and .xinirc.
- **Locker**: Utilizing xscreensaver and xautolock for screen locking.
- **XF Daemon**: Simplifying configuration with xfce4-settings for those lazy moments.

## Additional Configurations
Feel free to explore and modify the color scheme to suit your taste. The XF Daemon ensures easy application of settings from xfce4-settings.
